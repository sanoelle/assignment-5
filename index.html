				<div class="about"><em>MCC</em> History</div>
				
				
					<div class="info2">MCP is a historical site in Maeverly South Hamlet. Once called the Maeverly Aid, MCC first opened its doors on April 14, 1946 as a rehabilitation centre for World War Two veterans.</div>
				
					<div class="info2">After four years of success, MCC became a public community centre, its main focus, the pool. It became the highlight of the community and, in 1953, began hosting social events, such as summer barbeques and Christmas bazaars, to help bring the community closer together. These events still continue today.</div>
				
					<div class="info">In 1959, MCP adopted the name, Maeverly Community Centre, and introduced its first swim team made up of seven participants&mdash;<em>the Maeverly's</em>. Now, in 2013, the Maeverly's have grown to over 150 athetes with countless awards in championship swimming.</div>
